										<dt>1. The Name of the Section</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>ISBA Section on Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical Statistics (ISBA/Biostat&Pharma).</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>2. The Purpose of the Section</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The primary purpose of the Section is to promote the research, application and dissemination of Bayesian methods and solutions for problems in Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical statistics. This covers the many facets of biostatistics, and statistics applied to medicine comprising both the clinical and non-clinical aspects of pharmaceutical statistics. It includes, non exhaustively,  optimal design and analysis of clinical trials (drugs, biologics,  and medical devices), Bayesian adaptive trial designs, medical decision making,  Benefit: risk assessment for regulatory decision making, model-based drug development (pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics / pharmacogenetics), biostatistics, bioinformatics and its applications to genetics, genomics and proteomics, and pharmacoeconomics.

In order to achieve this purpose, the section activities consist of:
									<ul>
										<li>Promoting education and use of Bayesian methods in Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical statistics by developing workshops, courses and webinars for students and practitioners</li>
										<li>Organizing short courses, workshops, conferences, webinars and sessions within ISBA meetings</li>
										<li>Promoting interactions among academia, regulatory agencies and industry</li>
										<li>Promoting interactions and outreach to pharma, medical device, and clinical trial professionals, with a focus on exploring how Bayesian statistics can solve their problems and fit their specific needs</li>
										<li>Connecting and bringing visibility to initiatives from academia, regulatory agencies and industry aimed at spreading Bayesian methods and ideas, by federating them under a common brand</li>
									        <li>Fostering faster/easier availability of Bayesian methods , via devepment of software packages and  publication in field-specific journals</li>
										</ul>
