						<h3>Our Mission</h3>
						<p>The primary purpose of the Section is to promote the research, application and dissemination of Bayesian methods and solutions for problems in 
						   Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical statistics. This covers the many facets of biostatistics, and statistics applied to medicine comprising both the 
						   clinical and non-clinical aspects of pharmaceutical statistics. It includes, non exhaustively, optimal design and analysis of clinical trials 
						   (drugs, biologics, and medical devices), Bayesian adaptive trial designs, medical decision making, Benefit: risk assessment for regulatory decision 
						   making, model-based drug development (pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics / pharmacogenetics), biostatistics, bioinformatics and its applications to 
							genetics, genomics and proteomics, and pharmacoeconomics.<br></br>
						   
				                   <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
				                   In order to achieve this purpose, the section activities consist of:
						   
				                   <ul>
				                   <li>Promoting education and use of Bayesian methods in Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical statistics by developing workshops, courses and webinars for students and practitioners</li>
						   <li>Organizing short courses, workshops, conferences, webinars and sessions within ISBA meetings</li>
						   <li>Promoting interactions among academia, regulatory agencies and industry</li>
						   <li>Promoting interactions and outreach to pharma, medical device, and clinical trial professionals, with a focus on exploring how Bayesian statistics can solve their problems and fit their specific needs</li>
						   <li>Connecting and bringing visibility to initiatives from academia, regulatory agencies and industry aimed at spreading Bayesian methods and ideas, by federating them under a common brand</li>
						   <li>Fostering faster/easier availability of Bayesian methods , via devepment of software packages and publication in field-specific journals</li>
				             	   </ul>

						<h3>Latest News</h3>
				                    <li> <b>2/26/2020</b>
					            <p>We are very pleased to announce our very first webinar. Dr. David Osthus will present about “Bayesian influenza forecasting modelling,” with a focus on recent work on the multiscale influenza forecasting model DANTE, a collaboration with Kelly R Moran. The preprint is available here: https://nature-research-under-consideration.nature.com/users/37265-nature-communications/posts/55426-multiscale-influenza-forecasting. This model extends Dr. Osthus and colleagues’ dynamic Bayesian model described in "Dynamic Bayesian Influenza Forecasting in the United States with Hierarchical Discrepancy (with Discussion)” that appeared in Bayesian Analysis (2019) Vol. 14, No. 1, pp. 261–312.</p>
                                                    
						    <p>The webinar will take place on Wednesday, March 18th, 2020, at 8:00am PST (4:00 pm CET).</p>

					            <p>The first 90 registrants will be able to participate interactively via the Zoom Conference platform. Members of the ISBA Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical Statistics Section will be given preference. Additional registrants will be able to view the Webinar live on a dedicated YouTube Channel (more information later).</p>
