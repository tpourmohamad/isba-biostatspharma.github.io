									<h3>Current Officers</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gary_opt.jpg" alt=""  /></span><b>Section Chair: Gary Rosner (2019-2020)</b><br>I am the Eli Kennerly Marshall, Jr., Professor of Oncology and Professor of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. At Johns Hopkins, I direct the Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics in the Department of Oncology and the Research Program in Quantitative Sciences at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. In addition to these roles, I serve on the National Cancer Institute’s Investigational Drug Steering Committee (IDSC), where I am co-Chair of the IDSC’s Clinical Trials Design Task Force and a member of the Pharmacology Task Force. I have been a member of the Steering Committee of the Statistics and Pharmacometrics Special Interest Group (SxP SIG) since its inception in 2016. SxP SIG, chartered by both the American Statistical Association (ASA) and International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISOP), promotes collaboration between statisticians and pharmacometricians, to enable each discipline to learn and grow from the other and to develop innovative approaches to model informed drug development. My biostatistical research concerns the application of Bayesian methods to improve clinical trial design and analysis, and the application of Bayesian nonparametric methods to the analysis of complex biological data. I am also Associate Editor for the journals Biometrics and Clinical Trials.</br></p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tony_opt.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Program Chair: Tony Pourmohamad (2019-2020)</b><br>I am a senior statistical scientist in the department of biostatistics at Genentech. Prior to joining Genentech, I received my Ph.D. from the department of Statistics and Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where my research focused on constrained optimization for computer experiments. Nowadays, I spend most of my time at the intersection of clinical and nonclinical statistics here at Genentech.</br></p>

From 2008 until 2014 I worked as a biostatistician at the German Cancer Research Center. My current research interests include the development of methods for predicting drug response and drug-drug synergies in personalised cancer therapy and of Bayesian hierarchical models for the integrative analysis of omics data. I am passionate about promoting the use of better statistical methods in biomedical research, both through teaching & advising and through method development and dissemination.</br></p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/freni_opt.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Treasurer: Anna Frenni Sterrantino (2019-2020)</b><br>I am a Researcher Associate in Statistics for Environmental Epidemiology at the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU), part of the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial College London. My research focuses on two themes: 1) Applied statistical methods in environmental epidemiological studies; and 2) developing methods for data with spatial and temporal structure.  I am interested in Bayesian approaches and Latent Gaussian Markov Random Fields and on the related computational aspects and to methods to improve small area analysis. Besides that, I am involved in extra-academic activities as co-chair of the Researchers’ Society promoting course/seminars and workshops for early career and PhD students.</br></p>

<b>Section Chair-elect: Rodney Sparapani (2020)</b></a><br>
I am an applied Bayesian working mainly in biostatistics.  Currently,
I hold an Associate Professorship in Biostatistics at the Institute
for Health and Equity of the Medical College of Wisconsin.  Virtually,
my entire 29 year career has been dedicated to biostatistics.  Eight
of these years were spent in the pharmaceutical industry: almost two
years in manufacturing and the rest in clinical trials for hepatitis,
cardiovascular disease and depression.
<br>
My research applies Bayesian methodology to modern biostatistical
problems such as survival analysis, precision medicine, health
services research, clinical/cross-over trials, causal inference,
comparative effectiveness research and big data/omics. For the last
ten years, I have focused on Bayesian machine learning, Bayesian
nonparametrics and the surrounding challenges of routine efficient
computation with user-friendly software such as the
<a href="https://github.com/rsparapa/bnptools">BART3 R package</a>
which I co-authored. My collaborative research has involved the
analysis of cancer treatments, cardiovascular disease and a wide
variety of other conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, hip
fracture and various forms of surgery.
<br>
As Chair-Elect and Chair (2021-2022) of this section, I will work to further
connections between biostatistical and pharmaceutical professionals
including planning annual, or biennial, meetings to promote the
application of Bayesian methods in these areas of study.
